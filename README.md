# REDS-versions

REDS (Realistic Experiments Design Suit) is a lifelike virtual environment to use in neuroscience experiments. The proposed method is built on a free, powerful and flexible game engine, Unity3D. It employs simple Unity tools, and enables researchers to design various near real-life 3D environments. This tool can be synchronized with several eye trackers and electroencephalography (EEG) systems. By minimizing existing methods restrictions, researchers can easily put objects on any place of the environment without any constraints. In addition, subjects are able to move freely as a first person character. Another novel feature of the proposed method is the ability to calculate the area of interest for each object , eye tracking features and EEG data at any time.
